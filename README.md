Required dependencies: GO (GOlang)
Optional: Fail2ban


To implement the Telegram bot, I used the library:
https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api

The Shell script records network parameters, server logins, and the Fail2ban report for the bot.
Run git clone in the root directory. 
Go to the bot folder. 
Then run the go build command to build the finished application. 
For tests and debugging, run the code: go run bot.go
